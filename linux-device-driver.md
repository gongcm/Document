# devfs 文件系统

在linux世界中一切皆文件，对于所有的硬件操作，linux应用提供了通用的一套api来满足所有的硬件操作。
对于linux驱动我们都需要/dev目录下面注册一个设备文件，利用标准的linux文件系统api对硬件进行操作。

linux提供了devfs来管理驱动设备文件，使可以简单控制。

```
//打开设备文件
int fd = open("/dev/fg",O_RDWR);

//设置一些硬件参数
ioctl(fd,CMD,args);

// 读写

write(fd,buffer,bufsize,0)
read(fd,buffer,bufsize,0);

//关闭文件

close(fd);
```

# sysfs 文件系统

sysfs 和 devfs一样属于内存文件系统，sysfs主要方便驱动调试，可以将一些硬件配置的参数以文件的方式导出到/sys目录下面，
在用户空间中可以操作sysfs文件来直接修改硬件相应的配置和功能。
```
#查看驱动注册信息
gongcm@OoO:~$ cat /sys/class/i2c-dev/i2c-0/name 
i915 gmbus dpb

#修改驱动一些参数
echo "" >> /sys/xxxx
```

// linux 4.4.15

/**
 * struct device - The basic device structure
 * @parent:	The device's "parent" device, the device to which it is attached.
 * 		In most cases, a parent device is some sort of bus or host
 * 		controller. If parent is NULL, the device, is a top-level device,
 * 		which is not usually what you want.
 * @p:		Holds the private data of the driver core portions of the device.
 * 		See the comment of the struct device_private for detail.
 * @kobj:	A top-level, abstract class from which other classes are derived.
 * @init_name:	Initial name of the device.
 * @type:	The type of device.
 * 		This identifies the device type and carries type-specific
 * 		information.
 * @mutex:	Mutex to synchronize calls to its driver.
 * @bus:	Type of bus device is on.
 * @driver:	Which driver has allocated this
 * @platform_data: Platform data specific to the device.
 * 		Example: For devices on custom boards, as typical of embedded
 * 		and SOC based hardware, Linux often uses platform_data to point
 * 		to board-specific structures describing devices and how they
 * 		are wired.  That can include what ports are available, chip
 * 		variants, which GPIO pins act in what additional roles, and so
 * 		on.  This shrinks the "Board Support Packages" (BSPs) and
 * 		minimizes board-specific #ifdefs in drivers.
 * @driver_data: Private pointer for driver specific info.
 * @power:	For device power management.
 * 		See Documentation/power/devices.txt for details.
 * @pm_domain:	Provide callbacks that are executed during system suspend,
 * 		hibernation, system resume and during runtime PM transitions
 * 		along with subsystem-level and driver-level callbacks.
 * @pins:	For device pin management.
 *		See Documentation/pinctrl.txt for details.
 * @msi_list:	Hosts MSI descriptors
 * @msi_domain: The generic MSI domain this device is using.
 * @numa_node:	NUMA node this device is close to.
 * @dma_mask:	Dma mask (if dma'ble device).
 * @coherent_dma_mask: Like dma_mask, but for alloc_coherent mapping as not all
 * 		hardware supports 64-bit addresses for consistent allocations
 * 		such descriptors.
 * @dma_pfn_offset: offset of DMA memory range relatively of RAM
 * @dma_parms:	A low level driver may set these to teach IOMMU code about
 * 		segment limitations.
 * @dma_pools:	Dma pools (if dma'ble device).
 * @dma_mem:	Internal for coherent mem override.
 * @cma_area:	Contiguous memory area for dma allocations
 * @archdata:	For arch-specific additions.
 * @of_node:	Associated device tree node.
 * @fwnode:	Associated device node supplied by platform firmware.
 * @devt:	For creating the sysfs "dev".
 * @id:		device instance
 * @devres_lock: Spinlock to protect the resource of the device.
 * @devres_head: The resources list of the device.
 * @knode_class: The node used to add the device to the class list.
 * @class:	The class of the device.
 * @groups:	Optional attribute groups.
 * @release:	Callback to free the device after all references have
 * 		gone away. This should be set by the allocator of the
 * 		device (i.e. the bus driver that discovered the device).
 * @iommu_group: IOMMU group the device belongs to.
 *
 * @offline_disabled: If set, the device is permanently online.
 * @offline:	Set after successful invocation of bus type's .offline().
 *
 * At the lowest level, every device in a Linux system is represented by an
 * instance of struct device. The device structure contains the information
 * that the device model core needs to model the system. Most subsystems,
 * however, track additional information about the devices they host. As a
 * result, it is rare for devices to be represented by bare device structures;
 * instead, that structure, like kobject structures, is usually embedded within
 * a higher-level representation of the device.

描述一个设备驱动信息，

/**
 * struct device_driver - The basic device driver structure
 * @name:	Name of the device driver.
 * @bus:	The bus which the device of this driver belongs to.
 * @owner:	The module owner.
 * @mod_name:	Used for built-in modules.
 * @suppress_bind_attrs: Disables bind/unbind via sysfs.
 * @probe_type:	Type of the probe (synchronous or asynchronous) to use.
 * @of_match_table: The open firmware table.
 * @acpi_match_table: The ACPI match table.
 * @probe:	Called to query the existence of a specific device,
 *		whether this driver can work with it, and bind the driver
 *		to a specific device.
 * @remove:	Called when the device is removed from the system to
 *		unbind a device from this driver.
 * @shutdown:	Called at shut-down time to quiesce the device.
 * @suspend:	Called to put the device to sleep mode. Usually to a
 *		low power state.
 * @resume:	Called to bring a device from sleep mode.
 * @groups:	Default attributes that get created by the driver core
 *		automatically.
 * @pm:		Power management operations of the device which matched
 *		this driver.
 * @p:		Driver core's private data, no one other than the driver
 *		core can touch this.
 *
 * The device driver-model tracks all of the drivers known to the system.
 * The main reason for this tracking is to enable the driver core to match
 * up drivers with new devices. Once drivers are known objects within the
 * system, however, a number of other things become possible. Device drivers
 * can export information and configuration variables that are independent
 * of any specific device.

# 总线驱动
1. struct bus_type

# 设备device和驱动driver匹配

linux 驱动模型基于总线模型，每个总线下有两个链表结构保存了该总线下的设备和驱动。
当有新的驱动或者设备注册时，首先会调用相应的device_add 或者driver_add 将驱动或者
设备添加到总线下的链表中，然后查找驱动和设备是否匹配（主要时总线的match函数），然后在调用
相应的probe函数进行匹配，注册相应的节点inode到文件系统中。

```

// 添加一个设备或者驱动到bus下的链表时

//
// device_add ---> device_attach ---> bus match --- > bus probe 

// driver_add ---> driver_attach ---> bus match ----> bus probe 

```
